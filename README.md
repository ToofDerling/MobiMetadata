# MobiMetadata

MobiMetadata is a .NET library you can use to read strongly typed metadata from .azw files and save all images (including HD images from the azw.res file) to a stream of your choice.  

The target framework is .NET 6.0, MobiMetdata uses a lot of recent language features and is fully async.
